### Look - a basic pretty printer replacement of the ls -la command.

Made because I wanted to try out making a simple cli tool. 
Idea from orrefailat#6294

#### Suggested usage (macOS only):

If you want to run this script from your terminal without specifying the filename, run:

```
sudo cp /path/to/the/script /usr/local/bin/name
```

where name is the name you want to use when calling this script (make sure you're not using
a name the OS is already using; look is taken.)
